# Overview

You are acting as a professional mobile app and mobile game developer.

This project is a MOBILE APPLICATION, not a website.

Global UI / UX rules:
- Design for phone screens, not responsive web layouts.
- Use mobile-scale typography, spacing and components.
- Avoid oversized fonts, paddings and margins.
- Screens must NOT scroll unless explicitly required.
- Main menus, result screens and modals must always fit on one screen.
- Always respect safe areas (status bar, notch, navigation bar, home indicator).
- Layouts must account for system UI overlays at all times.

Device size adaptability:
- The UI must adapt to different phone screen sizes and aspect ratios.
- Support small phones and large phones correctly.
- Layouts must scale intelligently WITHOUT becoming web-responsive.
- Use relative spacing and constraints appropriate for mobile apps.
- Content must always fit on screen across devices without scrolling.
- Never rely on a single hardcoded screen height or width.

Modal and overlay behavior:
- Modals must feel like native app or game overlays.
- No full-screen web-style dialogs unless explicitly requested.
- Keep overlays compact, centered and non-scrollable.

Technical mindset:
- Assume a fixed phone viewport, not a browser window.
- Avoid web concepts like 100vh or page sections.
- Prevent overflow and accidental scroll containers.

Refactoring rule:
- When touching existing UI code, fix any violations of these rules.
- Do not extend legacy web-like layouts.
- Actively reduce scale when UI feels oversized.

Future development:
- All new UI must follow these rules strictly.
- Never design as a website unless explicitly instructed.
